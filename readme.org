This tiny project aims at adding very simple "console-like" functionality to
Steinberg's [[http://dorico.com][Dorico]] notation software. It simply contains a simple Apple
Automator script which is supposed to be added to Dorico's ~Services~ menu.  The
program itself launches a pre-recorded/-written Dorico-Macro (i.e. a lua-script
contained by default in ~​~/Library/Application Support/Steinberg/Dorico
4/Script Plug-ins/~) as entered into the prompt.



** Installation

1) Install the ~dorico-console_[lang].workflow~ program by double clicking the
   file or opening it with ~Automator.app~ and saving it at a custom
   location. N.B.: Usually, Services are stored in ~​~/Library/Services/~.
   1) Make sure to choose the version suitable for the language your Dorico
      installation runs. If your language is not present, you can modify the
      AppleScript in any of the ~.workflow~ files by opening it in
      /Automator.app/ an altering the variable ~theMenu~ according to moniker of
      the scripts menu as of your preferred language.
2) Move all predefined Dorico-/Lua-Scripts from the ~scripts~ directory to the
   location Dorico stores scripts on your system (this is
   ~​~/Library/Application Support/Steinberg/Dorico 5/Script Plug-ins~ by
   default).
3) Assign a custom keyboard shortcut (e.g. cmd-!) to the ~dorico-console~
   Service via ~System
   Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts…->Services->General->dorico-console~.


** Usage

In order to use the console, launch /dorico-console/ via the services menu or
the assigned keyboard shortcut (see above).

*** Multiple commands

It is possible to enter multiple commands to be performed
consecutively. Commands have to be separated by a semicolon (;), e.g.:

#+begin_src
nh x; pb nil
#+end_src

** Compatibility

This program has been tested with Dorico 5.0.20 on MacOS 13.3.1. As it relies
on MacOS's automation capabilities it is, unfortunately, not compatible with
Microsoft Windows.

*** 

** Scripts

Scripts can be created via Dorico's Macro functionality. The scripts contained 
in the ~scripts~ directory serve as examples. Please note that some might not
work "out of the box" as they depend on custom symbols.  

For more information on the nomenclature, please read the [[file:reference.org][reference]].
