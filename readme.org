This tiny project aims at adding very simple "console-like" functionality to
Steinberg's [[http://dorico.com][Dorico]] notation software. It simply contains a simple Apple
Automator script which is supposed to be added to Dorico's ~Services~ menu.  The
program itself launches a pre-recorded/-written Dorico-Macro (i.e. a lua-script
contained by default in ~ ~/Library/Application Support/Steinberg/Dorico
4/Script Plug-ins/~) as entered into the prompt.

** Compatibility

This program has been tested with Dorico 5.0.20 on MacOS 13.3.1. As it relies
on MacOS's automation capabilities it is, unfortunately, not compatible with
Microsoft Windows. 

** Installation

1) Install the ~dorico-console.workflow~ program by double clicking the file or
   opening it with ~Automator.app~ and saving it at a custom location. N.B.:
   Usually, Services are stored in ~~/Library/Services/~.
2) Move all predefined Dorico-/Lua-Scripts from the ~scripts~ directory to the
   location Dorico stores scripts on your system (this is
   ~~/Library/Application Support/Steinberg/Dorico 5/Script Plug-ins~ by
   default).
3) Assign a custom keyboard shortcut (e.g. cmd-!) to the ~dorico-console~
   Service via ~System
   Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcutsâ€¦->Services->General->dorico-console~.
